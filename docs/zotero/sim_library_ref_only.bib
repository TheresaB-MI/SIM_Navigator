The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

	abstract = {The access-to-justice crisis is bigger than law and lawyers. It is a crisis of exclusion and inequality. Today, access to justice is restricted: only some people, and only some kinds of justice problems, receive lawful resolution. Access is also systematically unequal: some groups–wealthy people and white people, for example–get more access than other groups, like poor people and racial minorities. Traditionally, lawyers and judges call this a “crisis of unmet legal need.” It is not. Justice is about just resolution, not legal services. Resolving justice problems lawfully does not always require lawyers' assistance, as a growing body of evidence shows. Because the problem is unresolved justice issues, there is a wider range of options. Solutions to the access-to-justice crisis require a new understanding of the problem. It must guide a quest for just resolutions shaped by lawyers working with problem-solvers in other disciplines and with other members of the American public whom the justice system is meant to serve.},

	abstract = {For millennia humans have sought, organized, and used information as they learned and evolved patterns of human information behaviors to resolve their human problems and survive. However, despite the current focus on living in an “information age,” we have a limited evolutionary understanding of human information behavior. In this article the authors examine the current three interdisciplinary approaches to conceptualizing how humans have sought information including (a) the everyday life information seeking–sense-making approach, (b) the information foraging approach, and (c) the problem–solution perspective on information seeking approach. In addition, due to the lack of clarity regarding the role of information use in information behavior, a fourth information approach is provided based on a theory of information use. The use theory proposed starts from an evolutionary psychology notion that humans are able to adapt to their environment and survive because of our modular cognitive architecture. Finally, the authors begin the process of conceptualizing these diverse approaches, and the various aspects or elements of these approaches, within an integrated model with consideration of information use. An initial integrated model of these different approaches with information use is proposed.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to clarify the conceptual issues of information behaviour research by reviewing the approaches to information interaction in the context of information seeking and retrieval (IS\&R). Design/methodology/approach The study uses the conceptual analysis focussing on four pioneering models for interactive IS\&R proposed by Belkin, Ingwersen and Ingwersen and Järvelin. Findings A main characteristic of models for information interaction is the tripartite setting identifying information resources accessible through information systems, intermediary/interface and user. Dialogue is a fundamental constituent of information interaction. Early models proposed by Belkin and Ingwersen focussed on the dialogue occurring in user-intermediary interaction, while more recent frameworks developed by Ingwersen and Järvelin devote more attention to dialogue constitutive of user-information system interaction. Research limitations/implications As the study focusses on four models developed within the period of 1984-2005, the findings cannot be generalised to depict the phenomena of information interaction as a whole. Further research is needed to model the specific features of information interaction occurring in the networked information environments in particular. Originality/value The study pioneers by providing an in-depth analysis of the ways in which pioneering researchers have conceptualised the phenomena of interaction in the context of IS\&R. The findings contribute to the elaboration of the conceptual space of information behaviour research.},

One key element of student-centered pedagogy involves understanding the cognitive psychological processes according to which students learn, and to structure our teaching with these processes in mind. This paper fills in a gap in the current literature, by applying empirically grounded lessons drawn from the cognitive science of learning, and discussing specific applications of these lessons for information literacy instruction. The paper outlines a framework for information literacy instruction, grounded in the educational and cognitive psychology literature, for facilitating student retention and transfer of information literacy skills, two classic measures of student learning. Five specific principles and several strategies for promoting retention and transfer within information literacy instruction are outlined.

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze a number of issues related to both education for and the practice of reading and readers’ advisory in library and information science (LIS). Written from the standpoint of an LIS educator, the paper is addressed to LIS professors, future and current LIS students, and public services librarians working in all types of libraries, including academic and special, because the practice of reading is no longer limited to school and public libraries. Librarians’ expertise can also benefit a larger community outside of the library walls, which would take outreach and embeddedness to an entirely new level. Design/methodology/approach The paper analyzes the situation in LIS education and reading practices based on a vast array of published sources and the author’s personal experience as an LIS educator. Findings The following problematic points are raised: modeling reading work and education for reading after information services and information science education, respectively; outdated pedagogical approaches; insufficient user orientation and excessive focus on materials; limiting reading activities to one to two types of libraries; insufficient community outreach; and, in general, the prevalence of responsive rather than proactive practices. Originality/value The paper proposes some solutions for the identified problems, the implementation of which depends on the collective effort and the collective will. However, it does not offer a particularly optimistic or upbeat view on the possibility of swift and sweeping changes.},

We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

Design/methodology/approach The study uses the conceptual analysis focussing on four pioneering models for interactive IS\&R proposed by Belkin, Ingwersen and Ingwersen and Järvelin. Findings A main characteristic of models for information interaction is the tripartite setting identifying information resources accessible through information systems, intermediary/interface and user. Dialogue is a fundamental constituent of information interaction. Early models proposed by Belkin and Ingwersen focussed on the dialogue occurring in user-intermediary interaction, while more recent frameworks developed by Ingwersen and Järvelin devote more attention to dialogue constitutive of user-information system interaction. Research limitations/implications As the study focusses on four models developed within the period of 1984-2005, the findings cannot be generalised to depict the phenomena of information interaction as a whole. Further research is needed to model the specific features of information interaction occurring in the networked information environments in particular. Originality/value The study pioneers by providing an in-depth analysis of the ways in which pioneering researchers have conceptualised the phenomena of interaction in the context of IS\&R.

	abstract = {Tidal power developments occurring in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia provide an informative case study of a natural resource management issue occurring in a coastal zone involving many stakeholders in several sectors. Research has shown that bridger organizations are important vehicles for forging connections and encouraging communication across sectoral boundaries in complex networks. Using a mixed-methods approach encompassing participatory mapping and social network analysis, this study examined stakeholder communication networks in the region, with a particular focus on identifying “bridger” organizations. The results show that communication within the tidal power network does cross sectors, and that bridger organizations are vital in connecting organizations across sectoral boundaries. Bridging activities are multifaceted with three distinct, yet complementary roles: coordinators, connectors, and information mediators. Numerous bridger organizations can co-exist within a network and they often specialize by working within specific sectors. Organizations from the NGO, research, and government sectors, in particular, feature prominently as bridgers within this network, in part because they are often seen as neutral brokers of information. By identifying the functions of bridgers and the sectors well-suited to perform these activities, this paper provides guidance to coastal and ocean managers, NGOs, government bodies, and research groups on where to deploy resources to support bridger organizations within natural resource development networks.},

This study of the early circulation of two texts by Nicolaus Maniacutius (†† ca. 1145), a Cistercian scholar in Rome, reveals that they were incorporated into other codices in Rome, London, and northern England through different types of scholarly networks, and suggests some of the modes of transmission. How these texts were circulated clearly indicates how each text was valued, and demonstrates how ““intellectual property”” was valued in twelfth-century Europe.},

	abstract = {This paper revisits the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy by examining the articulation of the hierarchy in a number of widely read textbooks, and analysing their statements about the nature of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. The hierarchy referred to variously as the ‘Knowledge Hierarchy’, the ‘Information Hierarchy’ and the ‘Knowledge Pyramid’ is one of the fundamental, widely recognized and ‘taken-for-granted’ models in the information and knowledge literatures. It is often quoted, or used implicitly, in definitions of data, information and knowledge in the information management, information systems and knowledge management literatures, but there has been limited direct discussion of the hierarchy. After revisiting Ackoff’s original articulation of the hierarchy, definitions of data, information, knowledge and wisdom as articulated in recent textbooks in information systems and knowledge management are reviewed and assessed, in pursuit of a consensus on definitions and transformation processes. This process brings to the surface the extent of agreement and dissent in relation to these definitions, and provides a basis for a discussion as to whether these articulations present an adequate distinction between data, information, and knowledge. Typically information is defined in terms of data, knowledge in terms of information, and wisdom in terms of knowledge, but there is less consensus in the description of the processes that transform elements lower in the hierarchy into those above them, leading to a lack of definitional clarity. In addition, there is limited reference to wisdom in these texts.},

METHODS: THE STUDY USED: (1) 2 initial focus groups of librarians; (2) a web-based survey of physicians, residents, and nurses at 56 library sites serving 118 hospitals; and (3) 24 follow-up telephone interviews. Survey respondents were asked to base their responses on a recent incident in which they had sought information for patient care. RESULTS: Of the 16,122 survey respondents, 3/4 said that they had definitely or probably handled aspects of the patient care situation differently as a result of the information. Among the reported changes were advice given to the patient (48\%), diagnosis (25\%), and choice of drugs (33\%), other treatment (31\%), and tests (23\%). Almost all of the respondents (95\%) said the information resulted in a better informed clinical decision. Respondents reported that the information allowed them to avoid the following adverse events: patient misunderstanding of the disease (23\%), additional tests (19\%), misdiagnosis (13\%), adverse drug reactions (13\%), medication errors (12\%), and patient mortality (6\%). CONCLUSIONS: Library and information resources were perceived as valuable, and the information obtained was seen as having an impact on patient care.},

The problem context determines the urgency, granularity of detail, authority, and level of certainty required for an acceptable answer and dictates the expertise and resources that can be brought to bear. The size and diversity of the sources that can be marshaled during clinical problem solving is cognitively unmanageable—too large and too complex for a single person to process effectively in a constrained timeframe. Can the clinical team, as currently constituted, collectively handle this information-processing task, or is there a need for special information expertise on the team? If there is such a need, what is the best way to prepare information specialists to participate in context-based problem solving? This article explores preparation for work in information-rich, problem-solving environments.

Objectives To measure specific CL impact on organisational and patient outcomes using a robust approach that helps CLs develop research skills. Methods Questionnaire and interviews. Results Clinical librarians contribute to a wide range of outcomes in the short and longer term reflecting organisational priorities and objectives. These include direct contributions to choice of intervention (36\%) diagnosis (26\%) quality of life (25\%), increased patient involvement in decision making (26\%) and cost savings and risk management including avoiding tests, referrals, readmissions and reducing length of stay (28\%). Discussion Interventions provided by CL's are complex and each contributes to multiple outcomes of importance to health care organisations. Conclusion This study is unique in taking a wide view of potential and specific impacts to which CLs contribute across health care organisations. It is the largest UK evaluation of CL services to date and demonstrates CLs affect direct patient care, improve quality and save money. Future researchers are urged to use the tools presented to collect data on the same outcomes to build a significant and comprehensive international evidence base about the effectiveness and impact of clinical librarian services.},

The most important components of a critical appraisal are an evaluation of the appropriateness of the study design for the research question and a careful assessment of the key methodological features of this design. Other factors that also should be considered include the suitability of the statistical methods used and their subsequent interpretation, potential conflicts of interest and the relevance of the research to one's own practice. This Review presents a 10-step guide to critical appraisal that aims to assist clinicians to identify the most relevant high-quality studies available to guide their clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	abstract = {Objective To identify estimates of time taken to search grey literature in support of health sciences systematic reviews and to identify searcher or systematic review characteristics that may impact resource selection or time spent searching. Methods A survey was electronically distributed to searchers embarking on a new systematic review. Characteristics of the searcher and systematic review were collected along with time spent searching and what resources were searched. Time and resources were tabulated and resources were categorized as grey or non-grey. Data was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results Out of 81 original respondents, 21\% followed through with completion of the surveys in their entirety. The median time spent searching all resources was 471 minutes, and of those a median of 85 minutes were spent searching grey literature. The median number of resources used in a systematic review search was four and the median number of grey literature sources searched was two. The amount of time spent searching was influenced by whether the systematic review was grant funded. Additionally, the number of resources searched was impacted by institution type and whether systematic review training was received. Conclusions This study characterized the amount of time for conducting systematic review searches including searching the grey literature, in addition to the number and types of resources used. This may aid searchers in planning their time, along with providing benchmark information for future studies. This paper contributes by quantifying current grey literature search patterns and associating them with searcher and review characteristics. Further discussion and research into the search approach for grey literature in support of systematic reviews is encouraged.},

Rapid reviews are a timely, and affordable approach that can provide actionable and relevant evidence to strengthen health policy and systems. This Practical Guide explores different approaches and methods for expedited synthesis of health policy and systems research, and provides guidance on how to plan, conduct, and promote the use of rapid reviews, while highlighting key challenges including their application in low- and middle-income countries.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness of five full-text drug databases as evaluated by medical librarians, pharmacy faculty, and pharmacy students at an academic health center. Study findings and recommendations are offered as guidance to librarians responsible for purchasing decisions. METHODS: Four pharmacy students, four pharmacy faculty members, and four medical librarians answered ten drug information questions using the databases AHFS Drug Information (STAT!Ref); DRUGDEX (Micromedex); eFacts (Drug Facts and Comparisons); Lexi-Drugs Online (Lexi-Comp); and the PDR Electronic Library (Micromedex). Participants noted whether each database contained answers to the questions and evaluated each database on ease of navigation, screen readability, overall satisfaction, and product recommendation. RESULTS: While each study group found that DRUGDEX provided the most direct answers to the ten questions, faculty members gave Lexi-Drugs the highest overall rating. Students favored eFacts. The faculty and students found the PDR least useful. Librarians ranked DRUGDEX the highest and AHFS the lowest. The comments of pharmacy faculty and students show that these groups preferred concise, easy-to-use sources; librarians focused on the comprehensiveness, layout, and supporting references of the databases. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the importance of consulting with primary clientele before purchasing databases. Although there are many online drug databases to consider, present findings offer strong support for eFacts, Lexi-Drugs, and DRUGDEX.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence-Based Practice requires health care decisions to be based on the best available evidence. The model "Information Mastery" proposes that clinicians should use sources of information that have previously evaluated relevance and validity, provided at the point of care. Drug databases (DB) allow easy and fast access to information and have the benefit of more frequent content updates. Relevant information, in the context of drug therapy, is that which supports safe and effective use of medicines. Accordingly, the European Guideline on the Summary of Product Characteristics (EG-SmPC) was used as a standard to evaluate the inclusion of relevant information contents in DB. OBJECTIVE: To develop and test a method to evaluate relevancy of DB contents, by assessing the inclusion of information items deemed relevant for effective and safe drug use. METHOD: Hierarchical organisation and selection of the principles defined in the EGSmPC; definition of criteria to assess inclusion of selected information items; creation of a categorisation and quantification system that allows score calculation; calculation of relative differences (RD) of scores for comparison with an "ideal" database, defined as the one that achieves the best quantification possible for each of the information items; pilot test on a sample of 9 drug databases, using 10 drugs frequently associated in literature with morbidity-mortality and also being widely consumed in Portugal. Main outcome measure Calculate individual and global scores for clinically relevant information items of drug monographs in databases, using the categorisation and quantification system created. RESULTS: A–Method development: selection of sections, subsections, relevant information items and corresponding requisites; system to categorise and quantify their inclusion; score and RD calculation procedure. B–Pilot test: calculated scores for the 9 databases; globally, all databases evaluated significantly differed from the "ideal" database; some DB performed better but performance was inconsistent at subsections level, within the same DB. CONCLUSION: The method developed allows quantification of the inclusion of relevant information items in DB and comparison with an "ideal database". It is necessary to consult diverse DB in order to find all the relevant information needed to support clinical drug use.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding how people participate in and contribute to online health communities (OHCs) is useful knowledge in multiple domains. It is helpful for community managers in developing strategies for building community, for organizations in disseminating information about health interventions, and for researchers in understanding the social dynamics of peer support. Objective: We sought to determine if any patterns were apparent in the nature of user participation across online health communities. Methods: The current study involved a systematic review of all studies that have investigated the nature of participation in an online health community and have provided a quantifiable method for categorizing a person based on their participation style. A systematic search yielded 20 papers. Results: Participatory styles were classified as either multidimensional (based on multiple metrics) or unidimensional (based on one metric). With respect to the multidimensional category, a total of 41 different participation styles were identified ranging from Influential Users who were leaders on the board to Topic-Focused Responders who focused on a specific topic and tended to respond to rather than initiate posts. However, there was little overlap in participation styles identified both across OHCs for different health conditions and within OHCs for specific health conditions. Five of the 41 styles emerged in more than one study (Hubs, Authorities, Facilitators, Prime Givers, and Discussants), but the remainder were reported in only one study. The focus of the unidimensional studies was on level of engagement and particularly on high-engaged users. Eight different metrics were used to evaluate level of engagement with the greatest focus on frequency of posts. Conclusions: With the exception of high-engaged users based on high post frequency, the current review found little evidence for consistent participatory styles across different health communities. However, this area of research is in its infancy, with most of the studies included in the review being published in the last 2 years. Nevertheless, the review delivers a nomenclature for OHC participation styles and metrics and discusses important methodological issues that will provide a basis for future comparative research in the area. Further studies are required to systematically investigate a range of participatory styles, to investigate their association with different types of online health communities and to determine the contribution of different participatory styles within and across online health communities.},

	abstract = {—As global policy makers prioritize big data policy, it is important to try to outline expected outcomes vis-à-vis health sector objectives. We identify initiatives aimed at promoting the use of big data in European Union (EU) health care, highlight expected challenges, and use these to evaluate EU big data policy developments to the extent that they are able to advance health sector priorities. A comprehensive approach is used to capture and examine peer-reviewed and gray literature publications on the use of big data in global health systems. This approach involved electronic database and specialist website searching, as well as complementary use of search engines and qualitative inputs from key EU policy stakeholders. Ongoing health data initiatives revolve around data center development, confidentiality and security, e-health and m-health, and genomics and bioinformatics. The literature acknowledges several main challenges to the successful integration of big data in health care, classified as either ethical (confidentiality and data security, access to information) or technical (data reliability, interoperability, data management and governance). EU data policy has started to address these issues, though additional work remains. A larger outstanding challenge is the lack of a comprehensive health and research policy strategy for big data that targets sectoral objectives. It remains unclear how big data integration will affect the quality and performance of health care in the EU. The promises of big data are being eroded by a failure to develop a coherent approach to adequately address conceptual, ethical, and technical challenges pertaining to its use within EU health systems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leadership is a necessary facet of professional practice for health library and information managers (HLIMs). Several training needs analyses (TNA) in the health library and information services field have been conducted in recent years, all identifying a need for professional development in leadership skills. However, these previous TNAs have not focused on specific elements of leadership skills required by health library and information managers. OBJECTIVES: The National Library for Health (NLH) commissioned the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) at the University of Sheffield to conduct a TNA where HLIMs assess their current leadership skills and identify any future development needs in this area. The results would inform a programme of influencing skills workshops. METHODS: HLIMs in the UK were invited to complete a self-assessment online questionnaire. The questionnaire utilised items from Manning and Robertson's Influencing Skills Style Profile (ISSP). This allowed the results to be characterised by influencing 'style'. RESULTS: HLIMs considered themselves to have strengths in the leadership areas of influencing, negotiating, managing change and delivering presentations to decision-makers. They identified significant development needs in communicating with stakeholders, conflict resolution, using body language and being assertive. Most HLIMs demonstrated two collaborative styles identified by the ISSP, namely strategic collaborator and opportunistic collaborator. CONCLUSIONS: In difficult times, HLIMs may need to adapt to more of an 'opportunistic-battler' influencing style. It is important that HLIMs not only assess their own leadership skills but also that they take opportunities to employ 360(°) feedback, comprising assessment from subordinates, peers and supervisors.},

	abstract = {Objective: Embedded librarianship has received much attention in recent years. A model of embeddedness rarely discussed to date is that of research-embedded health librarians (REHLs). This study explores the characteristics of Canadian REHLs and the situations in which they are employed. Methods: The authors employed a sequential, mixed-method design. An online survey provided descriptive statistics about REHLs' positions and work experiences. This informed a series of focus group interviews that expanded upon the survey. Through constant comparison, we conducted qualitative descriptive analysis of the interviews. Results: Based on twenty-nine survey responses and four group interviews, we created a portrait of a “typical” REHL and discovered themes relevant to REHL work. REHLs may identify more strongly as researchers than as librarians, with corresponding professional needs and rewards. REHLs value “belonging” to the research team, involvement in full project lifecycles, and in-depth relationships with nonlibrarian colleagues. Despite widely expressed job satisfaction, many REHLs struggle with isolation from library and information science peers and relative lack of job security. Conclusions: REHLs differ from non-embedded health librarians, as well as from other types of embedded librarians. REHLs' work also differs from just a decade or two ago, prior to widespread Internet access to digital resources. Implications: Given that research-embedded librarianship appears to be a distinct and growing subset of health librarianship, libraries, master's of library and information science programs, and professional associations will need to respond to the support and education needs of REHLs or risk losing them to the health research field.},

	abstract = {Objective: The paper identifies and documents new health sciences librarian activities and roles during the period from 1990–2012. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using MEDLINE, Library and Information Abstracts, Library Literature, Scopus, and Web of Science. To find new roles that might not yet have been described in the literature, job announcements published in the Medical Library Association email discussion list archives from 2008–2012 were searched. For inclusion, an article needed to contain a substantive description of a new role and/or activity performed by librarians and be in the field of medical or health sciences librarianship. Papers that did not describe an actual (rather than proposed) librarian role were excluded. Results: New roles identified through the literature search were: embedded librarians (such as clinical informationist, bioinformationist, public health informationist, disaster information specialist); systematic review librarian; emerging technologies librarian; continuing medical education librarian; grants development librarian; and data management librarian. New roles identified through job announcements were digital librarian, metadata librarian, scholarly communication librarian, and translational research librarian. New twists to old roles were also identified: clinical medical librarian, instruction librarian, outreach librarian, and consumer health librarian. Conclusions: While the main purposes of health sciences librarianship remain the same, the new roles represent major new activities so that, for many librarians, daily on-the-job work is completely different. Implications: This list of new activities should inform students contemplating medical librarianship careers, guide formal and continuing education programs, and encourage other librarians to consider these new services.},

Rigorous evaluations should demonstrate the value of CL services, but guidance is needed before this can be achieved. Objectives: To undertake a systematic review which examines models of CL services, quality, methods and perspectives of clinical librarian service evaluations. Methods: Systematic review methodology and synthesis of evidence, undertaken collaboratively by a group of 8 librarians to develop research and critical appraisal skills. Results: There are four clear models of clinical library service provision. Clinical librarians are effective in saving health professionals time, providing relevant, useful information and high quality services. Clinical librarians have a positive effect on clinical decision making by contributing to better informed decisions, diagnosis and choice of drug or therapy. The quality of CL studies is improving, but more work is needed on reducing bias and providing evidence of specific impacts on patient care. The Critical Incident Technique as part of a mixed method approach appears to offer a useful approach to demonstrating impact. Conclusions: This systematic review provides practical guidance regarding the evaluation of CL services. It also provides updated evidence regarding the effectiveness and impact of CL services. The approach used was successful in developing research and critical appraisal skills in a group of librarians.},

One key element of student-centered pedagogy involves understanding the cognitive psychological processes according to which students learn, and to structure our teaching with these processes in mind. This paper fills in a gap in the current literature, by applying empirically grounded lessons drawn from the cognitive science of learning, and discussing specific applications of these lessons for information literacy instruction. The paper outlines a framework for information literacy instruction, grounded in the educational and cognitive psychology literature, for facilitating student retention and transfer of information literacy skills, two classic measures of student learning. Five specific principles and several strategies for promoting retention and transfer within information literacy instruction are outlined.

It argues that although the Framework demonstrably opens up possibilities for an information literacy instruction that encourages students to question the power structures and relations that shape information production and consumption, it nonetheless rests on a theoretical foundation at odds with that goal. It urges librarians to embrace the Framework yet also resist it, in the tradition of critical librarians who have practiced resistance to the instrumentalization of the library for neoliberal ends.},

The Project forms part of Phase II of the Programme. The ETL Project is seeking to identify factors leading to high quality learning environments within five disciplinary contexts across a range of higher education institutions. Meyer’s notion of a threshold concept was introduced into project discussions on learning outcomes as a particular basis for differentiating between core learning outcomes that represent ‘seeing things in a new way’ and those that do not. A threshold concept is thus seen as something distinct within what university teachers would typically describe as ‘core concepts’. Furthermore, threshold concepts may represent, or lead to, what Perkins (1999) describes as troublesome knowledge – knowledge that is conceptually difficult, counter-intuitive or ‘alien’. Drawing both on project interviews and on observations contributed by academic colleagues from a range of disciplines, the report attempts to define characteristics of threshold concepts and, in the light of Perkins’ work, to indicate correspondences between the notion of threshold concepts and that of troublesome knowledge.},

Assessing both instructor performance and student learning can justify academic programs or services, help refine learning outcomes, measure teacher performance accountability,or provide feedback on the efficacy of instruction. In this chapter, we are focusing on assessment as a classroom practice, in tandem with a discussion of institutional concerns that embody the more commodified aspects of higher education.

The article provides a pedagogical framework grounded in constructivism and active learning for the approach to the information literacy session, including justifications for the deviation from the lesson plan as created when the class was taught face to face. It discusses best practices indicated by the experience, as well as limitations and changes the librarian would have made after a critical analysis of the session. Among the considerations discussed are issues of engagement, access, accessibility, and student support, and suggestions are made as to how academic libraries can learn from this experience to bring more information literacy instruction to online learners.},

	abstract = {Over the past fifteen years, librarians have increasingly looked to theory as a means to destabilize normative discourses and practices within LIS, to engage in inclusive and non-authoritarian pedagogies, and to organize for social justice. "Critlib," short for "critical librarianship," is variously used to refer to a growing body of scholarship, an intellectual or activist movement within librarianship, an online community that occasionally organizes in-person meetings, and an informal Twitter discussion space active since 2014, identified by the \#critlib hashtag. Critlib "aims to engage in discussion about critical perspectives on library practice" but it also seeks to bring "social justice principles into our work in libraries" (http: //critlib.org/about/).The role of theory within librarianship in general, and critical librarianship more specifically, has emerged as a site of tension within the profession. In spite of an avowedly activist and social justice-oriented agenda, critlib–as an online discussion space at least–has come under fire from some for being inaccessible, exclusionary, elitist, and disconnected from the practice of librarianship, empirical scholarship, and on-the-ground organizing for socioeconomic and political change. At the same time, critical librarianship may be becoming institutionalized, as seen in the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education, the January 2015 editorial in College and Research Libraries that specifically solicited articles using critical theory or humanistic approaches, and the publication of several critical librarianship monographs by the Association of College and Research Libraries.This book features original research, reflective essays and conversations, and dialogues that consider the relationships between theory, practice, and critical librarianship through the lenses of the histories of librarianship and critical librarianship, intellectual and activist communities, professional practices, information literacy, library technologies, library education, specific theoretical approaches, and underexplored epistemologies and ways of knowing.Karen Nicholson is Manager, Information Literacy, at the University of Guelph, and a PhD candidate (LIS) at Western University, both in Ontario.

This essay begins with a close reading of the Framework for Information Literacy, followed by an analysis of its ideological underpinnings, specifically liberalism. I then use postcolonial and political theory to think through the role of historical difference in pedagogy generally and in the information literacy pedagogy articulated by the Framework more specifically. The hegemonic ideological liberalism of the Framework, its universality, narrative of progress, and disinterest in power, must be supplemented with historical difference in order to provide context for its truth claims and to inculcate responsibility to the other. This work could take the form of kairotic information literacy pedagogy, or local and contextual articulations of the Framework, or something else. The Framework is not worthless or useless, but it is also not the answer.},

	abstract = {Digital libraries (DLs) are complex information systems and therefore demand formal foundations lest development e\#orts diverge and interoperability su\#ers. In this paper, we propose the fundamental abstractions of Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, and Societies (5S), which contribute to define digital libraries rigorously and usefully. Streams are sequences of abstract items used to describe static and dynamic content. Structures can be defined as labeled directed graphs, which impose organization. Spaces are sets of abstract items and operations on those sets that obey certain rules. Scenarios consist of sequences of events or actions that modify states of a computation in order to accomplish a functional requirement. Societies comprehend entities and the relationships between and among them. Together these abstractions relate and unify concepts, among others, of digital objects, metadata, collections, and services required to formalize and elucidate "digital libraries". The applicability, versatility and unifying power of the theory is demonstrated through its use in three distinct applications: building and interpretation of a DL taxonomy, analysis of case studies of digital libraries, and utilization as a formal basis for a DL description language. Keywords: digital libraries, theory, foundations, definitions, applications 1 1 Motivation Digital libraries are extremely complex information systems. The proper concept of a digital library seems hard to completely understand and evades definitional consensus. Di\#erent views (e.g., historical, technological) and perspectives (e.g., from the library and information science, information retrieval, or human-computer interaction communities) have led to a myriad of di\#ering definitions.

However, new media and new genres are best understood by examining the ways in which they refashion or 'remediate' older forms.

Virtual reality remediates film as well as perspective painting; digital photography remediates the analogue photograph; the World Wide Web refashions almost every previous visual and textual medium. Furthermore, older media can remediate newer ones. For example, television is making such extensive use of computer graphics that TV screens often look like pages of the web.},

When decisions need to made because of budget or staffing restrictions, alternative solutions can be a challenge. The purpose of this presentation is to explore an alternative solution to host digital content in house for small libraries. This work seeks to explore using the single board computer called "BeagleBone Black", to host the institutional repository software Omeka. There are advantages to being able to host organizational content in house, and this solution could be an alternative that allows a library to have more control at a lower cost. This project will take the reader through process of ordering, setting up the BeagleBone Black with Ubuntu, and then installing Omeka. The authors will show conclusions and suggest next steps for the reader to take if they are interested in replicating the work. The intent is to make the reader aware of cost effective solutions to manage content and be able to share it with the community they are trying to reach.},

It also compared the similarities and differences in perceptions of the appropriateness of digital library evaluation measures of two groups. Sixty-one participants were recruited representing scholars and academic digital librarians. The participants were instructed to fill in an in-depth survey consisting of 174 measures associated with 10 evaluation dimensions and 82 criteria. The findings of this study highlight the most appropriate measures in each dimension and show significant agreement in identifying appropriate measures by digital library scholars and librarians. Differences in the rating of the measures were found between the two groups in the dimensions of “interface design,” “system and technology,” “effects on users,” “administration,” “user engagement,” and “context.” The significance of this study lies not only in the integration of the perspectives on measures from both researchers and practitioners, but also in providing an inclusive list of measures to guide practitioners to effectively evaluate digital libraries in academic settings.},

The extensive digitization of library, museum, and other cultural heritage collections represents an important teaching resource. Yet, searching and selecting digital primary sources appropriate for classroom use can be difficult and time-consuming. This study investigates the design requirements and the potential usefulness of a domain-specific ontology to facilitate access to, and use of, a collection of digital primary source materials developed by the Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. During a three-phase study, an ontology model was designed and evaluated with the involvement of social studies teachers. The findings revealed that the design of the ontology was appropriate to support the information needs of the teachers and was perceived as a potentially useful tool to enhance collection access. The primary contribution of this study is the introduction of an approach to ontology development that is user-centered and designed to facilitate access to digital cultural heritage materials. Such an approach should be considered on a case-by-case basis in relation to the size of the ontology being built, the nature of the knowledge domain, and the type of end users targeted.},

Therefore, the interoperability among the Digital Library System (DLS) which manage the digital resources of these institutions is a key concern in the field.DLS are rooted in two foundational models of what a digital library is and how it should work, namely the DELOS Reference Model and the Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, Societies (5S) model. Unfortunately these two models are not exploited enough to improve interoperability among systems.To this end, we express these foundational models by means of ontologies which exploit the methods and technologies of Semantic Web and Linked Data. Moreover, we link the proposed ontologies for the foundational models to those currently used for publishing cultural heritage data in order to maximize interoperability.We design an ontology which allows us to model and map the high level concepts of both the 5S model and the DELOS Reference Model. We provide detailed ontologies for all the domains of such models, namely the user, content, functionality, quality, policy and architectural component domains in order to make available a working tool for making DLS interoperate together at a high level of abstraction. Finally, we provide a concrete use case about digital annotation of illuminated manuscripts to show how to apply the proposed ontologies and illustrate the achieved interoperability between the 5S and DELOS Reference models.

Only one semi-automated approach was found in the library literature which met our requirements for implementation, and even though it catered to the particular needs of the DSpace IR, it could be implemented to other IR software if further customizations were applied., The following paper presents an extension of this semi-automated approach originally created by Deng and Reese, but customized and adapted to address the particular needs of the Digital Commons community and updated to integrate the latest Resource Description \& Access (RDA) content standards for ETDs.

	abstract = {Purpose This article aims to evaluate a new architecture for scalable decision-making and control in preservation environments for its ability to address five key goals: scalable content profiling; monitoring of compliance, risks and opportunities; efficient creation of trustworthy plans; context awareness; and loosely coupled preservation ecosystems. Scalable decision support and business intelligence capabilities are required to effectively secure content over time. Design/methodology/approach We conduct a systematic evaluation of the contributions of the SCAPE Planning and Watch suite to provide effective and scalable decision support capabilities. We discuss the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of advancing the state of art and report on a case study with a national library. Findings The system provides substantial capabilities for semi-automated, scalable decision-making and control of preservation functions in repositories. Well-defined interfaces allow a flexible integration with diverse institutional environments. The free and open nature of the tool suite further encourages global take-up in the repository communities. Research limitations/implications The article discusses a number of bottlenecks and factors limiting the real-world scalability of preservation environments. This includes data-intensive processing of large volumes of information, automated quality assurance for preservation actions, and the element of human decision-making. We outline open issues and future work. Practical implications The open nature of the software suite enables stewardship organizations to integrate the components with their own preservation environments and to contribute to the ongoing improvement of the systems. Originality/value The paper reports on innovative research and development to provide preservation capabilities. The results of the assessment demonstrate how the system advances the control of digital preservation operations from ad hoc decision-making to proactive, continuous preservation management, through a context-aware planning and monitoring cycle integrated with operational systems.},

	url = {https://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12833},
	abstract = {While the concepts of the fonds, respect des fonds, and provenance were initially useful in Canada to offset ad hoc approaches to arrangement and description, the intellectual reality of provenance and the physical reality of the records have become so intertwined over time that the essential distinction between the creator and the created has been lost. The Rules for Archival Description, for example, establishes an approach to the fonds that does not allow for the description of virtual bodies of records, accumulated over time and scattered over space. To reassess the concept of provenance, the author examines the use of the term in archaeology and museology. Adapting these definitions to the archival context, the author argues that archivists should describe the records that remain and explain the history of the creator, their records and how they came to be in that institution. Archivists should expand the existing elements in RAD "for immediate source of acquisition" and "custodial history" and focus on a new vision, not of respect des fonds, but of respect de provenance, which would encompass creator history, records history, and custodial history. Archival descriptions should encompass all these elements, so that archivists offer the broadest possible contextualization of records and, at the same time, become more accountable for their own actions and more transparent about the management of the records in their care. Archivists should abandon the concept of the fonds, since that idea labels records as something they cannot be, ignoring the reality of their existence over time and space. RÉSUMÉAlors que les concepts de fonds, respect des fonds et provenance furent d'abord utilisés au Canada afin de contrebalancer les approches ad hoc de la classification et de la description, la réalité intellectuelle de la provenance et la réalité physique des documents sont devenues tellement entrelacées que la distinction essentielle entre ceux-ci et leur créateur a été perdue. Les Règles pour la description des documents d'archives, par exemple, prescrivent une approche pour le fonds qui ne permet pas la description d'ensembles virtuels de documents, accumulés à divers moments du temps et dispersés en divers lieux. Afin de réévaluer le concept de provenance, l'auteure examine l'utilisation de ce terme dans les domaines de l'archéologie et de la muséologie. En adaptant ces définitions au contexte de l'archivistique, elle soutient que les archivistes devraient décrire les documents qui subsistent, écrire l'histoire de leur créateur et de l'ensemble des documents créés et, enfin, décrire comment les documents ont été acquis par leur institution. Les archivistes devraient en fait étendre les éléments existants des RDDA pour la « source immédiate d'acquisition » et l'« historique de la conservation » et mettre l'accent sur une nouvelle façon de voir qui ne serait pas celle du respect des fonds mais du respect de la provenance, comprenant l'histoire du créateur, l'histoire des documents et l'historique de la conservation. La description des documents d'archives devrait comprendre tous ces éléments, ce qui permettrait aux archivistes de replacer les documents dans le contexte le plus large possible et, dans le même temps, de devenir plus responsables pour leurs décisions et plus transparents dans la gestion des documents dont ils ont la garde. Les archivistes doivent abandonner le concept de fonds parce que cette idée caractérise les documents comme ils ne pourront jamais être, en ignorant la réalité de leur existence dans le temps et l'espace.},

The relationship between professional and amateur varies across disciplines. The subject matter of geography is familiar to everyone, and the acquisition and compilation of geographic data have become vastly easier as technology has advanced. The authority of traditional mapping agencies can be attributed to their specifications, production mechanisms and programs for quality control. Very different mechanisms work to ensure the quality of data volunteered by amateurs. Academic geographers are concerned with the extraction of knowledge from geographic data using a combination of analytic tools and accumulated theory. The definition of NeoGeography implies a misunderstanding of this role of the professional, but English lacks a basis for a better term.},

	abstract = {Drawing on critical pluralism and positionality, this essay offers a four-part framework for making sense of the manifold ways place has been studied and applied to landscape planning and management. The first element highlights how diverse intellectual origins behind place research have inhibited a trans-disciplinary understanding of place as an object of study in environmental planning and management. The second focuses on ontological pluralism as found in attempts to make sense of place meanings by (a) fleshing out four layers of place meaning that vary in terms of tangibility, commonality, and emotionality and (b) critiquing four methodological approaches to identifying place meanings. The third looks at making sense of place-making as a way to highlight ontological and epistemic pluralism in studies of the material and social-discursive practices that create, govern, and transform places. In particular it draws attention to the way place meanings, knowledge, and practices are always situated or positioned. The fourth highlights axiological or normative pluralism as reflected in various prescriptive notions of place-making as the outcome of deliberate efforts of people to try to shape, contest, and/or otherwise govern the landscape. These include place as bios, ethnos, and demos as normative ideals for prescribing what constitutes a good place and underscores the challenge of adjudicating across different conceptions of sensible places. This paper concludes by reiterating the ways that place research and practice can benefit from both a critical pluralist perspective and a heightened awareness of the diverse positionalities occupied by observers of and actors in the landscape.},

Harley (1932-1991) offers an alternative to the dominant view that Western cartography since the Renaissance has been a progressive technological, scientific, and objective trajectory of development. This traditional view asserts that maps produce an accurate relational model of terrain and, as such, epitomize representational modernism, which is rooted in the project of the Enlightenment; in sum, maps banish subjectivity from the image. Accordingly, cartographers have promoted a standard scientific model for their discipline, one in which a mirror of nature can be projected through geometry and measurement. Cartographers often mistakenly assess early maps by this modern yardstick, excising from the accepted canon of mapping not only maps from the premodern era but also those from other cultures that do not match Western notions of accuracy."–Jacket.},

We can all be data collectors, adding locational information as we capture digitally our day-to-day experiences. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are the software tools that facilitate this, turning the raw data into useful information that can help us understand our worlds better.Principles of Geographical Information Systems presents a thorough overview of the subject, exploring both the theoretical basis of GIS, and their use in practice. It explains how data on the world are converted into digital form and the analytical capabilities used to bring understanding to a range of areas of interest and issues. Spatial data are usually based on two, dichotomous paradigms: exactly defined entities in space, such as land parcels and urban structures, or the continuous variation of single attributes, such as temperature or rainfall. The adoption of one or the other influences how the geographical data are structured in the GIS and the types of analysis possible. A further area of focus in the book concerns the problems of data quality and how statistical errors in spatial data can affect the results of spatial modelling based on the two paradigms of space. Fuzzy logic and continuous classification methods are presented as methods for linking the two spatial paradigms. The book concludes with an overview of current developments and trends in providing spatial data to an ever-expanding global community of users.Online Resource CentreThe Online Resource Centre to accompany Principles of Geographical Information Systems features:For students:DT Links to useful software and software providers for GISDT Datasets with instructions of how to repeat analyses presented in the book using widely-used softwareFor registered adopters of the book:DT Figures from the book, available for download Previous publication dates February 1998, July 1986},

	abstract = {"Preface What is big data? Due to increased interest in this phenomenon, many recent papers and reports have focused on defining and discussing this subject. A review of these publications would point to a consensus about how big data is perceived and explained. It is widely agreed that big data has three specific characteristics: volume, in terms of large-scale data storage and processing; variety, or the availability of data in different types and formats; and velocity, which refers to the fast rate of new data acquisition. These characteristics are widely referred to as the three Vs of big data, and while projects involving datasets that only feature one of these Vs are considered to be big, most datasets from such fields as science, engineering, and social media feature all three Vs. To better understand the recent spurt of interest in big data, I provide here a new and different perspective on it. I argue that the answer to the question of "What is big data?" depends on when the question is asked, what application is involved, and what computing resources are available. In other words, understanding what big data is requires an analysis of time, applications, and resources. In light of this, I categorize the time element into three groups: past (since the introduction of computing several decades ago), near-past (within the last few years), and present (now). One way of looking at the time element is that, in general, big data in the past meant dealing with gigabyte-sized datasets, in the near-past, terabyte-sized datasets, and in the present, petabyte-sized datasets. I also categorize the application element into three groups: scientific (data used for complex modeling, analysis, and simulation), business (data used for business analysis and modeling), and general"– Big data has always been a major challenge in geoinformatics as geospatial data come in various types and formats, new geospatial data are acquired very fast, and geospatial databases are inherently very large.

	abstract = {This paper uses a series of interviews to investigate how municipal planners in three Canadian provinces (Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Ontario) influence setbacks that regulate appropriate locations for wind turbines. Setbacks are provisions in local land use policies that dictate required separation distances between wind turbines and other land uses. Results of the study indicate that planners are not using a consistent method to ascertain appropriate distances and are often constrained by a lack of experience, resources, and expertise. These findings have important implications for wind energy regulation. Setbacks are intended to reasonably protect the public from the impacts of wind turbines, while allowing for some development. Municipalities in Canada may be best placed to consider local impacts of wind power, but the challenges identified raise concerns about potential arbitrariness. Setbacks that are unjustifiably high can unnecessarily close off territory and limit the ability to reach renewable energy targets. Taking regulatory power away from municipalities, as has happened in Ontario, can facilitate achievement of provincial targets, but may also increase opposition to projects at the local level.},

MSP involves several steps which were supported by using geographical information systems (GISs), multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and optimization. GIS was used in identifying overlapping coastal uses and mapping conflict hotspots. MCDA was used to incorporate the preferences of user groups and managers into a formal decision analysis procedure. Optimization was applied in generating optimal allocation alternatives to competing uses. Through this analysis three important objectives that build a foundation for future planning of Kenya's coastal waters were achieved: 1) engaging competing stakeholders; 2) illustrating how MSP can be adapted to aid decision-making in multi-use coastal regions; and 3) developing a draft coastal use allocation plan. The successful application of MSP to resolve conflicts in coastal regions depends on the level of stakeholder involvement, data availability and the existing knowledge base.},

	abstract = {This perspectives paper uses the seminal article of Goodchild (1992) as a lens through which to review and reflect upon several longstanding issues that have influenced the field of geographic information science in the past and will continue to be important at least into the next decade. Under the category of theory, the continuing issue of ‘tool versus science’ now has implications for the defining of geographic information systems (GISs) as a profession. In turn, a brief perspective is offered on how GIS has contributed to ‘methodological versus substantive’ questions in science, leading to the understanding of how the Earth works versus how the Earth should look. Both understandings of the Earth are particularly germane to the emergence of tools and applications such as marine and coastal GIS, virtual globes, spatial cyber infrastructure, and the ethics of GIS. And in the realm of marine and coastal GIS, the example of multidimensional data structuring and scaling is used to highlight an underlying lesson of Goodchild (1992) in that theory and application are in no way mutually exclusive, and it may often be application that advances theory, rather than vice versa. Indeed, it may be this reversal that is ushering in a ‘post-GISystems’ world, where GIS is subsumed into a broader framework known simply as ‘the web,’ divorced from the desktop, but providing a new paradigm for GIS (aligned with the ‘fourth paradigm’ of Hey et al. 2009). As so much data and information will be collected spatially in a way not possible before (e.g., the ‘big data’ of global observational science), GIS will need to be both system and science to support the turn toward more place-based research across increasing scientific domains. GIS is needed also by society at large to guide the understanding of the longstanding fundamentals of geolocation, scale, proximity, distance decay, the neighborhood, the region, the territory, and more.},

The discourse on information behavior primarily draws on the cognitive viewpoint, while information practice is mainly inspired by the ideas of social constructionism.

However, despite the current focus on living in an “information age,” we have a limited evolutionary understanding of human information behavior. In this article the authors examine the current three interdisciplinary approaches to conceptualizing how humans have sought information including (a) the everyday life information seeking–sense-making approach, (b) the information foraging approach, and (c) the problem–solution perspective on information seeking approach. In addition, due to the lack of clarity regarding the role of information use in information behavior, a fourth information approach is provided based on a theory of information use. The use theory proposed starts from an evolutionary psychology notion that humans are able to adapt to their environment and survive because of our modular cognitive architecture. Finally, the authors begin the process of conceptualizing these diverse approaches, and the various aspects or elements of these approaches, within an integrated model with consideration of information use. An initial integrated model of these different approaches with information use is proposed.},

	abstract = {Meta-synthesis methods may help to make more sense of information behaviour research evidence. The objectives are to: 1) identify and examine the theoretical research strategies commonly used in information behaviour research; 2) discuss meta-synthesis methods that might be appropriate to the type of research studies normally encountered in information behaviour research; and 3) propose some approaches. The methods are literature-review based, with reflection and discussion of an existing meta-synthesis of research on women's information behaviour.Information behaviour reviews are categorised according to prevailing paradigm and these paradigms mapped to those used in reviews of meta-synthesis in social science.The range of inquiry paradigms used in information behaviour research is varied, with a strong emphasis on psychological (positivistic) approaches and constructivism. There are many approaches to meta-synthesis and the choice depends on the desired outcomes, as the example meta-synthesis illustrates.Meta-synthesis approaches such as meta-ethnography and critical interpretive synthesis may be applied to research in information behaviour.},

By identifying key factors affecting the successful communication and use of information, it is hoped that the model will be of practical value both to information providers and to users. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on a literature search and analysis of well-established models of information seeking and of communication, from which a new conceptual model is constructed. Findings – Existing models have elements in common, though most models in library and information science focus on information seeking and the information user, while those from the field of communications focus on the communicator and the communication process. A new model is proposed that includes key elements of existing models and takes into account not just the information seeker but also the communicator or information provider. Originality/value – The model developed in this paper is the first to combine elements from both information seeking and communication models. Being built on previous research, it can be used to investigate the practical value of the model itself and the elements that it has in common with other models.},

The obsessive discoverer's complex and the ‘discovery’ of growth in sociological theory. American Journal of Sociology , 92(1), 158–163.] To admit that knowledge is intrinsically erroneous is not to imply that we should forego it. [McGuire, W. J. (1986).

Georgoudi (Eds.), Contextualism and understanding in behavioral science: implications for research and theory. New York: Praeger, 271–301.] It is not enough for theory to describe and analyze, it must itself be an event in the universe it describes. In order to do this theory must… tear itself from all referents and take pride in the future. Theory must operate on time at the cost of a deliberate distortion of present reality. [Baudrillard, J. (1988). The ecstasy of communication. New York: Semiotext(e).] The purpose I have mandated for this article is to explore the implications of articulating the bridges that are built, usually implicitly, between metatheory and method, and between these and their ultimate interests, the doing of research. The purpose is to articulate the uses of methodology. To chart this as a mandate is to assume, in contradiction to extant wisdom, that: (1) the journey has not yet been fully mapped; and (2) in fact there are multiple and everchanging ways of bridging these gaps with no one agreed upon single set of criteria by which the results can be evaluated. Above these assumptions is a higher level assumption that impels this journey – that taking an explicitly and self-consciously methodological approach is necessary to the improvement of the enterprise of systematic study. It is the primary purpose of this paper to illustrate by example the statements made above. The argument supporting the statements can be found elsewhere (A longer version of this paper is available which includes arguments regarding inattentions to methodology and a bibliography which includes authors writing on the issue. Readers who wish a copy may contact dervin.1@osu.edu). Suffice it to say here that the statements above rest on the assumption that in the midst of the paradigm battles which mark today's study of humans and their conditions, methodology as a term is highly contested, much abused, and frequently ignored. It is referred to either as method, or as metatheorical critique of the constructing of theory. It is, thus, either collapsed into method or collapsed into metatheory and in either locale it disappears. Rarely, however, is methodology attended to as that branch of metatheory which involves the reflexive analysis and development of methods – with methods defined broadly as methods of theorizing, observing, data collecting, analyzing, and interpreting. The result is that we lack a vocabulary for talking about methodology, a vocabulary which attends to the philosophic mandate in the term, the way in which it might build a bridge between metatheoy and method, and, thus, make more obvious the impacts of these on research and its theory-constructings.},

In turn, each component contains a number of variables that are described with examples from the literature.

This tendency to accumulate informatio enables managers to behave as they do, for example, making rapid decisions, jumping from problem to problem and foregoing the formal information search process that non-managers may follow when seeking to close a gap in knowledge. Three hypotheses will be empirically tested by statistically comparing line managers to non-managers. A questionnaire is used to gather quantitative data on the line-managers' perceptions and information behaviors.

One activity that consumes much of a scientist's time is developing models that balance contradictory and redundant evidence. Driven by our desire to understand the information behaviors of this important user group, and the behaviors of scientific discovery in general, we conducted an observational study of academic research scientists as they resolved different experimental results reported in the biomedical literature. This article is the first of two that reports our findings. In this article, we introduce the Collaborative Information Synthesis (CIS) model that reflects the salient information behaviors that we observed. The CIS model emerges from a rich collection of qualitative data including interviews, electronic recordings of meetings, meeting minutes, e-mail communications, and extraction worksheets. Our findings suggest that scientists provide two information constructs: a hypothesis projection and context information. They also engage in four critical tasks: retrieval, extraction, verification, and analysis. The findings also suggest that science is not an individual but rather a collaborative activity and that scientists use the results of one analysis to inform new analyses. In Part 2, we compare and contrast existing information and cognitive models that have inadvertently reported synthesis, and then provide five recommendations that will enable designers to build information systems that support the important synthesis activity.},

	abstract = {HIV/AIDS information is an important resource for people affected by the disease, particularly information that they obtain from other people. Although existing studies reveal that people with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) rely extensively on personal relationships for HIV/AIDS information, they explain little about how this happens as a social process. To investigate how PHAs and their friends/family members acquire and share network-mediated HIV/AIDS information, semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted in three rural regions of Canada. Interviews were carried out with 114 PHAs, their friends/family members, and health care and service providers. A network solicitation and chain-referral recruitment procedure was used to delineate HIV/AIDS information networks for participants. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively and compared to Haythornthwaite's (1996) concepts of network-mediated information processes and Talja and Hansen's (2006) collaborative information behavior framework. Findings revealed that participants obtained HIV/AIDS information from their networks through five interactive processes: joint seeking, tag-team seeking, exposure, opportunity, and legitimation. The results of this study advance information behavior theory by pointing to the interactive character of information behavior and introducing new concepts to describe everyday life collaborative information behavior. This research also demonstrates the extensive interplay between health information exchange and the sharing of emotional support. The insights emanating from this study suggest that health information practice might benefit from a focus on program strategies such as building information network capacity, developing collaborative information retrieval systems and relationship-building, in addition to the more traditional library-related concerns of reference encounters, collections, and institutional Web sites.},

	abstract = {Research and theories of information behavior have traditionally focused on the \&quot;information man,\&quot; i.e., on the individual as a seeker and user of information. The collective aspects of information behavior have been conceptualized, for instance, as consulting, informal seeking, use of person sources, and peer influence. These conceptualizations suggest a one-way process in which an individual consults another individual, however, information acquisition and filtering often is undertaken as a collective and collaborative effort. The paper develops a conceptual framework for the description of types and levels of information sharing in relation to document retrieval in academic communities. The concepts of strategic information sharing, paradigmatic information sharing, directive information sharing, and social information sharing are introduced to describe differences in the goals and purposes of information sharing in different groups and contexts of interaction.},

The project phases were evaluation of alternative solutions; development and testing; and summary of experiences. The project types were incremental; radical; and fundamental. Eight major characteristics were identified in the patterns: surveying; chaining; monitoring; browsing; distinguishing; filtering; extracting and ending. The study analyses the requirements for different types of information in an environment where the need for internal and external resources are intertwined; it also compares features of the information seeking patterns of engineers and research scientists from this and previous studies. It was found that, although there were differences in the features of the information seeking patterns of the research scientists and engineers, the behavioural characteristics were similar; and the study identified identical or very similar categories of information seeking behaviour to those of previous studies of academic researchers.},

Through a comprehensive literature review and clearly grounded analysis of rich data, this work supports the contention that adolescent social groups in which SNs are embedded form a distinct domain, and establishes a rationale for further investigation of adolescents’ contextualized use of SNs within social relationships.},

Little research has addressed their information‐seeking, especially regarding nonschool contexts. Thus, empirically‐based conceptual tools are needed to help professionals in mediating the complex information worlds of tweens. Guided by multiple frameworks (Dervin’s sense‐making, Fisher’s information grounds, and Chatman’s normative behavior), data were collected using the “Tween Day” technique, involving scenario‐based focus groups and interviews with thirty‐four youth in three distinct settings. The study aimed at understanding the situations for which tweens seek everyday information; which sources they use, and why; what social settings foster information‐sharing, and how; and what factors (especially affective) promote or hinder information‐seeking. Using these findings, the proposed professional service framework contains five descriptive principles for mediating everyday‐life information‐seeking and information use by tweens.},

	abstract = {Collaborative information seeking (CIS) has lately produced interesting empirical studies, describing CIS in real-life settings. While these studies explore how and why CIS manifests itself in different domains, discussions about how to study CIS have been scarce. The research area of CIS may, however, benefit from a discussion of methodological issues. This chapter describes the application of three methods for collecting and analyzing data in three CIS studies. The three methods are Multidimensional Exploration, used in a CIS study of students’ information behavior during a group assignment; Task-structured Observation, used in a CIS study of patent engineers; and Condensed Observation, used in a CIS study of information-systems development. The three methods are presented in the context of the studies for which they were devised, and the experiences gained using the methods are discussed. The chapter shows that different methods can be used for collecting and analyzing data about CIS incidents. Two of the methods focused on tasks and events in work settings, while the third was applied in an educational setting. Commonalities and differences among the methods are discussed to inform decisions about their applicability in future CIS studies and, more generally, to foster methodological discussions in CIS research.},

Theories and models of human information behaviour have developed over several decades but have not considered the role of the user's computing device in digital information interactions. The purpose of this paper is to explore the information behaviours of young adults when they are given unlimited access to mobile tablet devices. , – As information tasks, behaviours and communities shift into digital environments, a researcher of these phenomena is required to mirror that movement with techniques that allow a full exploration of human behaviour and interaction in the online world. Following Kozinets (2009), “netnography” (ethnography in online communities) is applied in this study and all data are collected online from within a community of iPad users, established for the research purpose. , – This study reveals that access to mobile tablet devices creates significant shifts in the behaviours of young adults whose lives are immersed in digital information. Mobile tablet devices establish the potential for constant access to digital information and that opportunity is grasped by the participants in this research. Extensive use of mobile device applications or “apps” establishes a more selected and restricted view of information than that encountered in the open and expansive World Wide Web. , – This paper invites extension to human information behaviour theories and models to include a consideration of computing access device and of new mobility and constancy of access – all of which changes the circumstances and behaviour of the information actor.},

Design/methodology/approach A critical and selective analysis of relevant literature is presented. Findings Immersive documents are likely to have a significant effect on library/information service provision, as it is to expected that novel information behaviours will emerge as these documents become widely used. Studies of immersive information behaviour and practices will be valuable in planning for how library/information services can best provide access to such documents, and may also guide the development of such documents. They may also contribute to the development of information behaviour research generally, and to better interaction between research and practice.

Our current understanding of human behavior is largely based on static “snapshots” of human behavior, rather than ongoing, dynamic feedback loops of behavior in response to ever-changing biological, social, personal, and environmental states. This paper first discusses how new technologies (i.e., mobile sensors, smartphones, ubiquitous computing, and cloud-enabled processing/computing) and emerging systems modeling techniques enable the development of new, dynamic, and empirical models of human behavior that could facilitate just-in-time adaptive, scalable interventions. The paper then describes concrete steps to the creation of robust dynamic mathematical models of behavior including: (1) establishing “gold standard” measures, (2) the creation of a behavioral ontology for shared language and understanding tools that both enable dynamic theorizing across disciplines, (3) the development of data sharing resources, and (4) facilitating improved sharing of mathematical models and tools to support rapid aggregation of the models. We conclude with the discussion of what might be incorporated into a “knowledge commons,” which could help to bring together these disparate activities into a unified system and structure for organizing knowledge about behavior.},

The issues and tensions that have characterized attempts to develop and implement policies on the national and organizational scale are discussed, with particular reference to: the power relations between the parties to them; the relative significance accorded to information technology and information content; the transition from formulating policy to acting on it; and the threats to the survival of those policies that get as far as implementation. In conclusion, the contribution to date of information science to the theory and practice of information policies is assessed, and suggestions are offered on directions for future efforts, in the light of the past of this interesting field.},

	abstract = {The profile of information policy in academic and policy-making circles has been rising in recent decades, a function, presumably, of the expansion of an ‘information society’. Nevertheless, there is widespread confusion over its meaning and purpose. This paper seeks to produce a clearer picture, building on useful groundwork in information science and other disciplines. The history of information policy is traced, featuring exposition of the pioneering contribution of Marc Porat in the 1970s. The present state of information policy is then described, with particular reference to some salient themes of current literature: issue inventories (i.e. the scope of information policy); academic identity (including a critique of attempts to appropriate information policy for one discipline); and the ideal – or, it is argued, illusion – of a ‘national information policy’. In the final section of the paper, some suggestions are made for the future direction of information policy. First, information policy should engage much more thoroughly with the tradition of political philosophy. Second, information policy may benefit from more forays into the field of futures studies. Finally, it is proposed that information policy could be positioned as a subset of the interdisciplinary specialism of information society studies, in which case its definition might be resolved in terms of the ‘normative theory of the information society’},

It commences with a brief overview of the history and contemporary context of national information policy before moving to an analysis of three fundamental concepts in information policy: (i) information, (ii) policy and (iii) information policy. The paper concludes that there is a significant lack of clarity in the information policy field regarding the meaning of these concepts. There are, however, frameworks in information studies and public policy studies which can be brought together to provide input for development of an intellectually rigorous field of information policy. Some of these frameworks and how they might be applied to information policy are described. A second paper in the series is foreshadowed with an indication that it will compare the scope of information policy and policy studies research and explore methodologies for value-critical and paradigm-critical approaches to information policy.},

The first part of the analysis was reported in an earlier paper and was linked to the call of Ian Rowlands for ‘value-critical and paradigm-critical’ approaches in information policy. The paper begins by comparing research in information policy with the output of the field of policy studies. It concludes that there are substantial gaps in the range of information policy research relative to the scope of policy studies. The gaps are located in areas where value-and paradigm-critical approaches could have most impact in taking the field of information policy to intellectual maturity. The implications of adopting value-and paradigm-critical approaches to scholarship are explored within the context of the new interpretative social sciences which are dominating much of contemporary scholarship. Some approaches and frameworks from the new methodologies which are seen as particularly relevant to information policy are described. A case is made for extending the range of research paradigms employed in information policy research in the interests of strengthening its currently inadequate intellectual foundations.},

This requires defining sustainability in terms of supporting community organizations that provide social development and related content and services to the public, with support for core services, content development as well as technical access and networking. The authors further argue that governments, and in particular the federal government, has the primary role for providing sustainability funding at the community level to address the digital divide and development goals. A conceptual approach is required that extends our understanding of the problem of the digital divide and sustainability to the everyday lived circumstances and needs of citizens and their local communities. Such an approach also permits us to consider sustainability in terms of being primarily a role for governments to provide funding to the community service organizations that provide services at the community level in order to address inequalities and under development. Funding should be used for technical services, the development and maintenance of core operations (staff, volunteers, overheads) and content services that can be accessed using communication technologies.},

Internet, World Wide Webs, MOSAIC, e-journals, word processors, and of course, hypertext are all pushed forward as examples of this triumph of technology, this liberation of the human reader and writer, this future of unlimited information for everyone. Yet, for all this, as has been outlined in detail elsewhere (see e.g., Dillon 1994), the typical reader of an electronic information source will likely suffer loss of orientation, lower reading speeds, and possibly greater fatigue than the typical reader of a paper document for few demonstrable benefits.},

This study investigated the effects of two design dimensions: Text Presentation (Plain Text vs In-Context) and Interactivity (availability of Reading Tools). Results show that the simplest textual environment (Plain Text presentation with no Interactivity) was associated with the highest comprehension outcomes, but that Interactivity mitigated the negative effects of texts presented In-Context. Both time spent reading and certain reading behaviours varied to some extent by condition and may be associated with comprehension; however, personal characteristics of the readers played little to no role in determining outcomes.},

Libraries in particular are often characterised as symbolic of predigital literacy practices and forms of meaning making. This binary oversimplifies student engagement, particularly in relation to their creation of and interactions with texts. Two studies illustrate this: an investigation of student and staff textual practices that explored the complex and emergent networks they created, adapted and maintained; and one that explored perceptions and use of library spaces (digital and physical). A sociomaterial analysis shows the ongoing importance of institutional, personal and public spaces. This demonstrates that in order to enhance the student experience, a more nuanced understanding of the complex, emergent relationships between digital and print, device and user, and author and text is required.},

	abstract = {Critical design is a research through design methodology that foregrounds the ethics of design practice, reveals potentially hidden agendas and values, and explores alternative design values. While it seems to be a timely fit for today's socially, aesthetically, and ethically oriented approaches to HCI, its adoption seems surprisingly limited. We argue that its central concepts and methods are unclear and difficult to adopt. Rather than merely attempting to decode the intentions of its originators, Dunne and Raby, we instead turn to traditions of critical thought in the past 150 years to explore a range of critical ideas and their practical uses. We then suggest ways that these ideas and uses can be leveraged as practical resources for HCI researchers interested in critical design. We also offer readings of two designs, which are not billed as critical designs, but which we argue are critical using a broader formulation of the concept than the one found in the current literature.},

However, new media and new genres are best understood by examining the ways in which they refashion or 'remediate' older forms. Computer graphics, virtual reality, and the World Wide Web define themselves by borrowing from and remediating television, film, photography and painting, as well as print. Virtual reality remediates film as well as perspective painting; digital photography remediates the analogue photograph; the World Wide Web refashions almost every previous visual and textual medium. Furthermore, older media can remediate newer ones. For example, television is making such extensive use of computer graphics that TV screens often look like pages of the web.},

But as the field has evolved since the first edition of this book, designers enter the field from many disciplines. Practitioners today have enough experience in UI design that they have been exposed to design rules, but it is essential that they understand the psychology behind the rules in order to effectively apply them.

However, when faced with unprecedented wicked problems such as these, the rigour of design and creative processes can tested. COVID-19 has demonstrated how important human centred design responses are in understanding the worldviews and ecosystems of users. Ad hoc design responses or design hacks have demonstrated that they have a role to play in how we create our future individual, community and societal ecosystems. In terms of age friendly design, this pandemic makes us envision what should be, furthermore, how we could create better products and services through technology. For our ageing communities ‘Cocooning’ and other social restriction measures have exposed technological deficiencies for the needs of older people and opens up questions of our future preparedness for a growing ageing society. Now more than ever, designers need to understand the behavioural mind-set of older people in their own ecosystem and understand existing mental models. In this opinion piece we posit what acts of design hacking can lead us to greater understanding of users mental models and therefore better understanding of technology needs for both older and younger adults. While presenting various examples of how design hacking is conducted by citizens and participants alike, it shows that it offers designers differing perspectives, experiences and inspiration for technology.},

Information architects (IAs) are in a position to address the challenge, starting by distinguishing between macro information overload and micro information overload. At the macro level, physical storage limits and processing capacities present an obstacle to information access. Information overload at the micro level is a failure to filter information, interfering with a user's cognitive processing by presenting too many images, concepts, messages and other elements to sort through. If systems architects are skilled at recognizing signs of macro information overload, IAs should be able to identify signals of overload at the micro level, drawing on user experience design methods, and should develop ways to spot when information presented on a web page threatens to exceed a typical user's threshold for effective cognitive intake. The solution presents fertile ground for research and potential time and cost savings.},

However, with new technologies and methodologies for research come new ethical concerns or at least the need to re-evaluate existing codes of conduct. Currently, many researchers appear to see little harm in meddling in the virtual realm. In fact, the lack of harm is touted as one of the advantages of virtual world research. Often, researchers rationalize that virtual worlds are fair game for a number of reasons – some reasonable, others questionable. These rationalizations are a product of an oversimplification of the reasons why people participate in virtual communities and virtual worlds. This paper will discuss the ethical issues and implications surrounding the use of virtual worlds as a sandbox for research.},

We developed a survey questionnaire to identify issues with the voting process and found that respondents consistently reported that wait times and lines were the greatest barriers to efficient and enjoyable voting. In contrast, few respondents reported difficulty with the voting interfaces themselves. We therefore developed a system to support improved voter organization, specifically focused on conveying relevant logistical information to voters: polling station data, including amenities (e.g., benches, parking) and estimated wait times. We also created an easy-to-use administrator portal for poll workers to update wait-time estimates. We believe that our approach represents a strong example for how usability testing and design can positively affect relevant societal issues.},

Thanks to the miniaturisation and decreasing cost of sensing technology, there is an increasing interest exploring this alternative input modality, but no comprehensive overview of its research landscape. In this survey, we review the literature on interfaces operated by the lower limbs. We investigate the characteristics of users and how they affect the design of such interfaces. Next, we describe and analyse foot-based research prototypes and commercial systems in how they capture input and provide feedback. We then analyse the interactions between users and systems from the perspective of the actions performed in these interactions. Finally, we discuss our findings and use them to identify open questions and directions for future research.},

Some contemporary design practices – especially Design Thinking – tend to simultaneously compound and conceal the oppressive effects of both neoliberalization and racism. Rarely does design proactively seek to unsettle racism from its own operations or the larger set of power hierarchies, which it upholds. This essay documents how neoliberalization has pushed design, capitalism, and racism to converge in formative ways; it interrogates the role of innovation in binding these systems together and producing new forms of racism and design; and it articulates how design reinscribes racism into its operations by dissecting elements of visual language, problem-framing, and empathy as a design sensibility in Moneythink’s IDEO.org-designed app for teens. This essay concludes by calling for an approach to social design that forces a reckoning with racism.},

We collected users’ reports about critical incidents and quantitative questionnaire data by means of an online survey. Results from N=221 participants suggest that distrust is mostly an effect of graphical (e.g., complex layout) and structural (e.g., pop-ups) design issues of a website, whereas trust is based on social factors such as reviews or recommendations by friends. The content of a website affects both trust and distrust: privacy issues had an effect on distrust and security signs enhanced trust. Furthermore, we show how trustful and distrustful user experiences differ in terms of perceived honesty, competence, and benevolence. High honesty and competence characterize a trustful experience, whereas a distrustful experience is associated with missing honesty and missing benevolence. We discuss how different website characteristics help to enhance trust or to prevent distrust and how this impacts the allocation of design resources.},

Two accounts are particularly vocal about these mechanisms, namely the technology acceptance model (TAM) and work on user experience (UX) models. In this study, we review 37 papers in the overlap between TAM and UX models to explore the experiential component of human–computer interactions. The models provide rich insights about what constructs influence the experiential component of human–computer interactions and about how these constructs are related. For example, the effect of perceived enjoyment on attitude is stronger than those of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. It is less clear why the relations exist and under which conditions the models apply. We discuss four of the main theories used in reasoning about the experiential component and, for example, point to the near absence of psychological needs and negative emotions in the models. In addition, most of the reviewed studies are not tied to specific use episodes, thereby bypassing tasks as an explanatory variable and undermining the accurate measurement of experiences, which are susceptible to moment-to-moment changes. We end by summarizing the implications of our review for future research.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a theory of information need for information retrieval (IR). Information need traditionally denotes the start state for someone seeking information, which includes information search using an IR system. There are two perspectives on information need. The dominant, computer science perspective is that the user needs to find an answer to a well-defined question which is easy for the user to formulate into a query to the system. Ironically, information science's best known model of information need (Taylor, 1968) deems it to be a “black box”—unknowable and nonspecifiable by the user in a query to the information system. Information science has instead devoted itself to studying eight adjacent or surrogate concepts (information seeking, search and use; problem, problematic situation and task; sense making and evolutionary adaptation/information foraging). Based on an analysis of these eight adjacent/surrogate concepts, we create six testable propositions for a theory of information need. The central assumption of the theory is that while computer science sees IR as an information- or answer-finding system, focused on the user finding an answer, an information science or user-oriented theory of information need envisages a knowledge formulation/acquisition system.},

The specific aims are: to identify the categories of grey materials stocked, and the method of acquisition; to examine the method of GL management and the degree of access in Illinois state libraries; and also to identify the challenges/solutions to the problems associated with GL management and access. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted in Illinois state, USA in 2010, using an online questionnaire posted to various listservs used by 118 academic libraries in Illinois, including those of the Consortia of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois and the Illinois Association of College and Research Libraries. The online survey questionnaire was designed to identify the categories of grey materials stocked by libraries, the method of acquisition and organization, the degree of access and the challenges/solutions to the problems associated with GL management and access. Simple frequencies and percentage were used in data analyses. Findings – The study identified various categories of grey stocked, including: theses and dissertations, faculty works, conference proceedings, research reports, in-house publications of associations, government documents and translations. The study diagnosed various challenges in the organization and dissemination of GL, and solutions to the challenges in order to ensure optimal access and utilization of grey materials. Practical implications – The implication of this work is that institutional and subject repositories are needed in order to aggregate these useful resources into globally accessible databases, where the resources will be rediscovered through international catalogues such as online computer library center and major web search engines such as Google. The end result will showcase the value of these resources to the public for greater access and utilization. Originality/value – The knowledge gained will help to more effectively manage and harness the current and factual contents of grey materials, for quality education, research and national advancement. The paper will be of benefit to libraries, librarians, educationists, researchers and decision makers globally.},

This wealth of scholarly knowledge is of significant importance for researchers in making scientific discoveries and healthcare professionals in managing health-related matters. However, the acquisition of such information is becoming increasingly difficult due to its large volume and rapid growth. In response, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is continuously making changes to its PubMed Web service for improvement. Meanwhile, different entities have devoted themselves to developing Web tools for helping users quickly and efficiently search and retrieve relevant publications. These practices, together with maturity in the field of text mining, have led to an increase in the number and quality of various Web tools that provide comparable literature search service to PubMed. In this study, we review 28 such tools, highlight their respective innovations, compare them to the PubMed system and one another, and discuss directions for future development. Furthermore, we have built a website dedicated to tracking existing systems and future advances in the field of biomedical literature search. Taken together, our work serves information seekers in choosing tools for their needs and service providers and developers in keeping current in the field.Database URL:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/search},

Access to resources is a central dimension in their research endeavor. While historians do not reject Ebooks as a research tool, they make use of this digital tool only in specific settings during their research and in their teaching. Additionally, our study found that historians attempt to recreate in the digital environment an atmosphere that encourages serendipity within their field, and would readily welcome new methods and designs that would make this possible.},

In total, 62 faculty and research staff participated. Findings – The results correspond with previous studies conducted in other countries. The humanists still stick to the printed information sources but they pay good attention to electronic resources. Most of them have access to computer and internet at office and home. They are regular users of a variety of electronic technologies. Although faced with many problems, the humanists perceive that modern technology made their work easier. Research limitations/implications – The study is based only on the humanities faculty in a large university of Pakistan. The survey should be replicated on a larger sample for generalization. Practical implications – Keeping in view the positive trend of humanists towards modern technology, universities and libraries should give more funding to provide electronic resources and facilities in the arts and humanities discipline. Special training programmes for humanists should be organized. Originality/value – This is the first study on this topic in Pakistan. The results can be useful to design services and facilities in humanities libraries and information centres in Pakistan and other developing countries.},

Academic librarians assist faculty in explaining their impact and productivity in their respective fields in part through information published to their websites. Terms/concepts associated with common metrics relating to scholarly impact were searched in the library websites of the 62 Association of American University (AAU) members. A total of 61 libraries had web pages or LibGuides providing information on these topics, with Journal Citation Reports and the Impact Factor being the most commonly discussed (100\%; 98.4\%). Slightly over 90\% (90.2\%) supplied information about the h-index and 80.3\% addressed altmetrics.

	doi = {10.1108/RSR-05-2013-0023},
	abstract = {Purpose – While the primary importance of citation searching continues to be connecting researchers to highly-related literature, additional uses for the data have developed. For example, academic institutions frequently recommend that faculty include a citation analysis in their tenure and promotion (t \& p) dossiers as a way of demonstrating the value of their research. Due to the limited number of tools available for this type of analysis in the past, Librarians were unable to help faculty create an exhaustive accounting of citations to their work. The aim of this paper is to provide examples of the growing number of tools that now exist to assist librarians and faculty in locating citation information for t \& p dossiers. Design/methodology/approach – An in-depth survey of both free and subscription resources to identify those that offered options for citation searching was conducted. Findings – Commercial vendors, organizations and researchers are developing a wide variety of tools that help track the impact of a faculty member's research. Research limitations/implications – The list of resources surveyed is not comprehensive. The research was focused on those available, and most relevant to the author's institution. Practical implications – Based on the results of this investigation, a web page was created to help direct faculty and librarians to a large number of resources for citation searching (available at: http://libresources.wichita.edu/citationsearching ). Originality/value – Librarians have prepared numerous web guides to assist faculty in conducting citation searches. Few offer links to as wide a variety of resources as this research presents.},

More and more companies are using social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter to provide various services and interact with customers. As a result, a large amount of user-generated content is freely available on social media sites. To increase competitive advantage and effectively assess the competitive environment of businesses, companies need to monitor and analyze not only the customer-generated content on their own social media sites, but also the textual information on their competitors’ social media sites. In an effort to help companies understand how to perform a social media competitive analysis and transform social media data into knowledge for decision makers and e-marketers, this paper describes an in-depth case study which applies text mining to analyze unstructured text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the three largest pizza chains: Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza and Papa John's Pizza. The results reveal the value of social media competitive analysis and the power of text mining as an effective technique to extract business value from the vast amount of available social media data. Recommendations are also provided to help companies develop their social media competitive analysis strategy.},

	abstract = {Today, the use of social networks is growing ceaselessly and rapidly. More alarming is the fact that these networks have become a substantial pool for unstructured data that belong to a host of domains, including business, governments and health. The increasing reliance on social networks calls for data mining techniques that is likely to facilitate reforming the unstructured data and place them within a systematic pattern. The goal of the present survey is to analyze the data mining techniques that were utilized by social media networks between 2003 and 2015. Espousing criterion-based research strategies, 66 articles were identified to constitute the source of the present paper. After a careful review of these articles, we found that 19 data mining techniques have been used with social media data to address 9 different research objectives in 6 different industrial and services domains. However, the data mining applications in the social media are still raw and require more effort by academia and industry to adequately perform the job. We suggest that more research be conducted by both the academia and the industry since the studies done so far are not sufficiently exhaustive of data mining techniques.},

	abstract = {Daniel Bell is recognised to be the foremost writer on the information society. The paper expounds his writings in detail, showing their development from the 1960s to the 1990s. It is argued that his position has always contained three distinguishable strands or elements: one relating to the post-industrial information workforce, a second dealing with information flows (particularly scientific knowledge), and a third concerning computers and the information revolution. Bell’s information society thesis is best understood as a synthesis of these elements. His arguments are also evaluated. It is suggested that the information economy element is not satisfactorily supported by the evidence cited and that his emphasis on theoretical knowledge may also be excessive. As regards Bell’s account of information technology, his position shifted from a technocratic preoccupation with mainframes to an uncritical enthusiasm for the micro-computer. In spite of such shortcomings, Bell’s synthetic information society thesis is the strongest available.},

	abstract = {Background. Many definitions of information, knowledge, and data have been suggested throughout the history of information science. In this article, the objective is to provide definitions that are usable for the physical, biological, and social meanings of the terms, covering the various senses important to our field. Argument. Information 1 is defined as the pattern of organization of matter and energy. Information 2 is defined as some pattern of organization of matter and energy that has been given meaning by a living being. Knowledge is defined as information given meaning and integrated with other contents of understanding. Elaboration. The approach is rooted in an evolutionary framework; that is, modes of information perception, processing, transmission, and storage are seen to have developed as a part of the general evolution of members of the animal kingdom. Brains are expensive for animals to support; consequently, efficient storage, including, particularly, storage at emergent levels-for example, storing the concept of chair, rather than specific memories of all chairs ever seen, is powerful and effective for animals. Conclusion. Thus, rather than being reductionist, the approach taken demonstrates the fundamentally emergent nature of most of what higher animals and human beings, in particular, experience as information.},

	abstract = {This paper explores whether or not our online social media persona is viewed as authentic. The selfie is a fundamental part of the structure of the online identity for young people in today’s digital world. The relationship between an individual’s self-identity in the physical face-to-face environment was analysed and compared to a carefully constructed, modified virtual representation in a selfie posted on social media platforms. Data was obtained through four focus groups at the University of Adelaide. Two key theoretical frameworks provide a basis for this study: Erving Goffman’s concept of the self as a performance, and Charles Horton Cooley’s concept of the looking glass self. In examining the focus group discussions in light of these two frameworks as well as associated literature, we conclude that the authenticity of the selfie as a way of visualising a social media persona is subjective and dependent on the individual posting a selfie. Ultimately, authenticity involves a degree of subjectivity. It was on this basis that focus group participants argued that selfies could be considered authentic expressions of identity.},

The broader question to be posed seems to be, under what circumstances is censorship justified, and how can it best be achieved? In this paper, we present the results of a study that illustrates the overwhelming harms to users that emerge from an unregulated Internet regime: 89 percent of ads delivered to Canadian users on 5,000 rogue sites for the most complained-about movies and TV shows were classified as “high risk”. We conclude that more granular policies on what should be censored and better tools to enforce those policies are needed, rather than accepting that censorship is impossible.},

	abstract = {The rapid improvement in DNA sequencing has sparked a big data revolution in genomic sciences, which has in turn led to a proliferation of bioinformatics tools. To date, these tools have encountered little adversarial pressure. This paper evaluates the robustness of such tools if (or when) adversarial attacks manifest. We demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, the synthesis of DNA which — when sequenced and processed — gives an attacker arbitrary remote code execution. To study the feasibility of creating and synthesizing a DNA-based exploit, we performed our attack on a modiﬁed downstream sequencing utility with a deliberately introduced vulnerability. After sequencing, we observed information leakage in our data due to sample bleeding. While this phenomena is known to the sequencing community, we provide the ﬁrst discussion of how this leakage channel could be used adversarially to inject data or reveal sensitive information. We then evaluate the general security hygiene of common DNA processing programs, and unfortunately, ﬁnd concrete evidence of poor security practices used throughout the ﬁeld. Informed by our experiments and results, we develop a broad framework and guidelines to safeguard security and privacy in DNA synthesis, sequencing, and processing.},
